title: 5 Ways Dewy Will Help Your Move To Drupal 8
---
Drupal 8 continues to mature and the possibility for large Drupal 7 organizations to make the jump comfortably is becoming more real. Having survived upgrading hundreds of sites for a large higher-ed institution from Drupal 5 to Drupal 7, I learned the biggest pain points that slowed the whole migration down:

* Not knowing all the modules we depended on

    Identifying all the modules we actually used on our environment and what sites used them was essential to figuring out what upgrade and migration paths we needed to plan for, as well as determining what sites could be migrated together. Unfortunately it was an extremely time consuming process to document. Even worse, by the time we had a full understanding of our environment, there was no guarantee our site admins hadn't already changed their sites.

* Having sites with different, outdated modules versions

    To make core upgrades and content migration the least painful they can be, it was important to get all sites onto the latest supported versions of their modules. But doing these module upgrades was made even more difficult than we anticipated because we had many sites running different versions of the same module, meaning an upgrade to one site may not have all the same steps as that same module's upgrade on another site.

* Difficulty reaching out to the users we scheduled for moves

    Once we had a sizable group of sites using only modules and content we had upgrade paths for, it was time to move the sites. Contacting the admins of these sites to confirm their move dates and to let them know of possible changes and disruption was a necessity. The time spent figuring out what the email addresses actually were of our admins were was frustrating.

* Migrating more stuff than we needed to

    We spent time moving sites we later identified weren't really in use at all and had no relevance to the digital strategy of the institution. The migration was long enough without spending time moving sites that no one cared about.

So how can Dewy help?

### 1. Spot sites with different module versions and pending upgrades

### 2. Find what modules aren't essential to your Drupal environment

### 3. Hunt down abandoned modules

### 4. Identify what sites that don't need to be moved at all

### 5. Organize what sites will be moved and what admins to contact
